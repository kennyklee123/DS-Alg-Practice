            the idea is that we loop through the array starting from the back and we handle two cases
            if the arr[i] < 9 we just increment arr[1] by 1 and we just return the array and are done
            if we dont enter this for loop, the digit is a 9 so we set it to 0 and go to the next iteration
            
            
            if we do not return at all using the for loop we had a number with all 9s so we just extend the array 
            and make the arr[0] = 1, since we know when we initalize an array, its filled with 0s
