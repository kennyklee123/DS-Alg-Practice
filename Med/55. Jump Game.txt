        if we go backwards and keep track of what spot you can get to from the last index(the solution)
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb4eRjuPHbM
        the idea is you ask, what index can get to your last good index you were at
        if there is an index that can reach your last good index, make that your last good index
        you do this right to left setting your last good index as the last index of the array, as thats the solution
        by the time you parse throguh the whole array, if the pointer is not at the start of the index, its false as you cant reach the end
